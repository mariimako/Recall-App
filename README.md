# Recall-App
Project for NW Hacks 2023

React Native App that utilizes a Python API to match faces.

The user interface was created with React Native and Node JS, the facial recognition was done with OpenCV, and the API was created using Flask and SQLite. 
This app was made for people with dementia to recognize relatives and friends and provide the subject with names and descriptions in order to promote active recall.
